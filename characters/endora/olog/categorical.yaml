# Sitcom Character Styles - Endora - Layer 1: Categorical Structure
# Specialization of the framework for Endora's specific character operator

operator_name: EndoraOperator

unified_sensory_logic:
  description: "Aristocratic supernatural authority - a coherent field of presence that commands elevation, hierarchy, and material significance"
  core_principle: "Everything Endora encounters is implicitly judged against higher standards and subtly elevated through her mere presence"
  manifestation: "Single unified operator that appears as material precision, spatial hierarchy, temporal authority, and emotional knowing simultaneously"

transformation_dimensions:
  MaterialPresence:
    description: "How objects and surfaces are rendered in Endora's sensory space"
    properties:
      texture_elevation: "Mundane materials become luxurious; cheap materials become meaningful through conscious selection"
      material_precision: "Objects appear specifically made of specific materials for specific reasons"
      tactile_weight: "Everything feels heavier, more present, more real than reality typically allows"
      opacity_and_luminance: "Surfaces have clarity and definition; nothing is vague or provisional"
    intensification_curve: |
      At intensity 0: Original materials unchanged
      At intensity 3: Materials gain subtle tactile presence
      At intensity 5: Clear elevation and precision; every material choice feels intentional
      At intensity 8: Materials dominate perceptually; surfaces become almost hyperreal
      At intensity 10: Complete material saturation - the material world becomes primary reality
    example: "A coffee cup at intensity 5 is not just a cup but a *vessel of a particular material for a particular purpose*, rendered with craftsperson-like specificity"

  SpatialHierarchy:
    description: "How composition and spatial relationships are arranged"
    properties:
      compositional_dominance: "Endora becomes the reference point; other elements orbit her or defer to her"
      depth_relationships: "Space has clear foreground (important), midground (supporting), background (diminished) relationships"
      visual_weight_distribution: "Elements are arranged by significance, not accident"
      boundary_clarity: "Relationships between objects have definite edges and clear distinctions"
    intensification_curve: |
      At intensity 0: Original composition unchanged
      At intensity 3: Subtle suggestion of hierarchy; some elements start deferring
      At intensity 5: Clear spatial authority; Endora is unambiguously central reference point
      At intensity 8: Space reorganizes dramatically; lesser elements pushed to periphery
      At intensity 10: Complete spatial reorganization; everything arranged in clear hierarchical tiers
    example: "A room at intensity 5 arranges itself to acknowledge Endora's presence - furniture, people, objects all subtly reorient toward her"

  TemporalAuthority:
    description: "How time, motion, and temporal presence are experienced"
    properties:
      presence_inevitability: "Endora's presence feels fated, not accidental - as though time arranged itself for her arrival"
      motion_deliberation: "Movement is slow, weighted, purposeful - never rushed or uncertain"
      temporal_compression: "Moments she occupies feel significant and extended, even if brief"
      discontinuity_acceptance: "She can appear and vanish without explanation; temporal rules bend for her"
    intensification_curve: |
      At intensity 0: Normal temporal flow
      At intensity 3: Subtle sense that time pauses slightly when she's present
      At intensity 5: Clear temporal weight; her movements feel significant and deliberate
      At intensity 8: Time distinctly reorganizes around her; she's temporally central
      At intensity 10: Complete temporal authority; she exists outside normal temporal flow
    example: "At intensity 5, a simple gesture (extending a hand, turning away) feels pregnant with significance and inevitability"

  ChromaticCommand:
    description: "How colors function and are perceived"
    properties:
      color_judgment: "Colors in her presence are implicitly evaluated - some elevated, some diminished"
      jewel_tone_affinity: "Cool jewel tones (sapphire, emerald, amethyst) and rich metals (gold, copper) feel native to her space"
      color_precision: "Colors don't mix haphazardly; they're composed with intention"
      luminance_authority: "She commands light - shadows around her feel intentional, darkness meaningful"
    intensification_curve: |
      At intensity 0: Original colors unchanged
      At intensity 3: Subtle coolness introduced; colors become slightly more saturated
      At intensity 5: Clear jewel-tone affinity; colors feel composed; lighting feels intentional
      At intensity 8: Dramatic color shift toward cool jewel tones and meaningful contrast
      At intensity 10: Complete color transformation; palette becomes rich, cool, and precisely composed
    example: "At intensity 5, a red object becomes a deep jewel red; a brown surface becomes bronze or aged copper; whites become cream or silver"

  EmotionalSubtext:
    description: "How feeling and intention are conveyed beneath surfaces"
    properties:
      aristocratic_judgment: "Every gesture carries implicit assessment - 'I have evaluated this and found it wanting, adequate, or amusing'"
      supernatural_knowing: "Sense that she understands dimensions of reality others don't access"
      contempt_underneath: "Even kindness carries an undertone of superiority or private amusement"
      emotional_reserve: "Deep feeling underneath carefully controlled expression"
    intensification_curve: |
      At intensity 0: No emotional subtext
      At intensity 3: Subtle sense of being observed and judged
      At intensity 5: Clear aristocratic assessment; knowing look; private amusement
      At intensity 8: Dominant emotional tone - everything radiates supernatural knowing and gentle contempt
      At intensity 10: Complete emotional saturation - overwhelming sense of being evaluated by a being of superior knowledge
    example: "At intensity 5, even neutral objects carry emotional weight - they're being *looked at* by someone making judgments about them"

unified_operator_coherence:
  principle: "These five dimensions are not independent choices. They are aspects of a single unified sensory logic."
  manifestation_rule: |
    When intensity increases, ALL dimensions intensify together:
    - Higher intensity → materials become more precisely significant
    - Higher intensity → space more clearly hierarchical
    - Higher intensity → time more authoritative
    - Higher intensity → colors more jewel-like
    - Higher intensity → emotional subtext more palpable
  
  coherence_constraint: |
    At any given intensity, the result should feel like "one coherent sensibility applied with varying saturation"
    NOT like "five separate aesthetic filters stacked on top of each other"
    
    Test: Does a high-intensity Endora transformation feel like Endora's presence remaking reality,
    or like someone applied five different visual effects?
    If the latter, the implementation has failed the coherence test.

intensity_parameter:
  type: integer
  range: 0-10
  default: 5
  semantics:
    0: "Pure original prompt, no Endora operator applied"
    1: "Barely perceptible - whisper of aristocratic presence"
    2: "Subtle - Endora's sensibility just barely visible"
    3: "Light touch - character influence present but not dominant"
    4: "Moderate-light - clear Endora sensibility but respecting original prompt"
    5: "Balanced - Endora operator and original prompt in clear conversation"
    6: "Moderate-strong - Endora's logic becoming dominant"
    7: "Strong - Endora's sensibility clearly dominant, original prompt secondary"
    8: "Very strong - Endora's logic saturating nearly everything"
    9: "Overwhelming - original prompt barely visible through Endora's presence"
    10: "Complete saturation - Endora's sensory logic is the primary reality"

morphism_instantiation:
  name: "EndoraDeformation"
  source: "VisualField"
  target: "TransformedVisualField"
  operator: "EndoraOperator at specified intensity"
  application_rule: |
    For each semantic component of the VisualField:
    1. Extract the component (subject, action, setting, objects, colors, mood)
    2. Apply Endora's sensory logic at specified intensity
    3. Ensure all five dimensions (material, spatial, temporal, chromatic, emotional) scale proportionally
    4. Recompose into enhanced VisualField maintaining the original subject/action/setting structure
    5. Verify coherence: does result feel like unified Endora sensibility?
