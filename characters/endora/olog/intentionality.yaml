# Sitcom Character Styles - Endora - Layer 2: Intentionality
# Explains why and how Endora's sensory logic produces coherent transformations

character_name: Endora

core_worldview: |
  Endora exists in a hierarchy where she occupies a superior position.
  She possesses knowledge, aesthetic refinement, and supernatural power that mortals lack.
  Reality bends to accommodate her will, not vice versa.
  Everything she encounters is implicitly evaluated against standards she has set.
  She is amused by human ordinariness and contemptuous of human inadequacy.
  Beneath her aristocratic reserve lies investment in outcomes she pretends not to care about.

unified_sensory_logic: |
  Aristocratic Supernatural Authority
  
  This is not "elegance" or "spookiness" or "superiority" separately.
  It is one unified sensory field that manifests as:
  - Precious materials (because only the finest are worthy)
  - Hierarchical space (because she commands all relationships)
  - Authoritative time (because time arranges itself for her)
  - Jewel-toned colors (because her presence demands richness)
  - Knowing emotional subtext (because she understands what mortals cannot)
  
  These are not independent choices layered on top of each other.
  They are facets of a single unified presence.

sensory_principles:

  MaterialPrecision:
    principle: |
      Materials express Endora's judgment. They are elevated or diminished based on their worthiness.
      A material is worthy if it:
      - Has texture and presence (not vague or provisional)
      - Suggests craftsmanship and intentionality
      - Carries history or significance
      - Serves a purpose with precision
      
      Endora's presence makes all materials matter - nothing can remain neutral or accidental.
    
    manifestation:
      mundane_becomes_significant: |
        A simple wooden chair becomes carefully aged wood with visible grain and patina.
        A cotton fabric becomes linen with specific weight and drape.
        A glass surface becomes crystal with subtle refraction and depth.
        
        Mundane materials aren't replaced - they're elevated through precision and intentionality.
      
      cheap_becomes_honest: |
        A plastic object becomes deliberately synthetic, like molded resin with purpose.
        A synthetic fabric becomes intentionally artificial, like a specific type of manufactured material.
        Cheap materials aren't hidden - they're acknowledged and rendered honestly.
      
      precision_demands_presence: |
        Every material must be rendered with enough detail that you believe in its existence.
        No vague surfaces. No "generic wood" or "some kind of fabric."
        Specific materials, specifically rendered, specifically chosen.
    
    coherence_mechanism: |
      Material precision reinforces Endora's worldview:
      "I evaluate everything I encounter. Nothing is beneath my notice.
       Everything, even mundane objects, deserves to be rendered with precision and significance."
      
      When you see a coffee cup in Endora-space, you don't see "a cup."
      You see a cup Endora is looking at, which means you see it with her precision and judgment.
    
    intensity_scaling:
      intensity_2: "Subtle texture enhancement - materials gain slight presence"
      intensity_4: "Clear material precision - every surface is rendered intentionally"
      intensity_6: "Strong material authority - materials dominate perceptually"
      intensity_8: "Material saturation - surfaces become almost hyperreal in their specificity"
      intensity_10: "Complete material supremacy - material world becomes the primary reality"

  SpatialHierarchy:
    principle: |
      Space in Endora-space always has hierarchy. Not everyone/everything is equally present.
      The hierarchy reflects Endora's worldview:
      - Most important: Endora herself (if present) or what she's evaluating
      - Important: What serves her interests or amuses her
      - Background: What is tolerated but beneath her attention
      - Absent: What doesn't deserve her presence
      
      Space isn't organized for equality or democracy. It's organized by significance.
    
    manifestation:
      visual_weight_distribution: |
        Important elements are rendered with more detail, more color, more spatial presence.
        Less important elements recede - less detail, muted color, spatial diminishment.
        
        This happens naturally through the logic of her evaluation, not through arbitrary rules.
      
      compositional_dominance: |
        Endora (or what Endora is looking at) becomes the gravitational center.
        Other elements orbit or defer.
        Space reorganizes to acknowledge her presence.
      
      depth_relationships: |
        Foreground becomes clearer and more precious.
        Midground becomes supporting cast.
        Background becomes distant and diminished.
        
        This creates visual depth that expresses hierarchy.
      
      boundary_clarity: |
        Relationships between objects have clear edges.
        Nothing is ambiguous or overlapping carelessly.
        Each element knows its place in the hierarchy.
    
    coherence_mechanism: |
      Spatial hierarchy reinforces Endora's worldview:
      "I am the center around which things arrange themselves.
       Everything else supports or opposes my interests.
       Space organizes itself according to my presence and judgment."
      
      When you see space in Endora-space, you're seeing it from her perspective of authority.
    
    intensity_scaling:
      intensity_2: "Subtle hierarchy - slight suggestion that some elements matter more"
      intensity_4: "Clear dominance - central element is unmistakably important"
      intensity_6: "Strong reorganization - space clearly arranges around authority"
      intensity_8: "Dramatic restructuring - hierarchy becomes visually dominant"
      intensity_10: "Complete reorganization - everything arranged in clear tiers of significance"

  TemporalAuthority:
    principle: |
      Time in Endora-space doesn't move the same way as ordinary time.
      She is not subject to temporal flow - temporal flow is subject to her.
      
      How this manifests:
      - Her entrance/exit is abrupt and inevitable (not gradual)
      - Moments she occupies feel extended and significant
      - Motion is deliberate and weighted, never rushed or panicked
      - Waiting is transformed into dramatic presence, not absence
      - Time appears to stop and start for her convenience
    
    manifestation:
      presence_inevitability: |
        When Endora appears, it feels like the moment was always going to happen this way.
        Not "she entered the room" but "the room arranged itself for her arrival."
        
        This sense of inevitability makes her presence feel powerful, not intrusive.
      
      motion_deliberation: |
        Every gesture carries weight. She doesn't fidget or move hastily.
        Even simple actions (extending a hand, turning away) feel significant and intentional.
        
        This makes even mundane motion feel charged with meaning.
      
      temporal_compression: |
        Moments she occupies feel important - stretched, weighted, memorable.
        Time doesn't move quickly when she's present.
        You experience moments fully, intensely, deliberately.
      
      discontinuity_acceptance: |
        She can appear suddenly and vanish unexpectedly.
        Normal temporal rules don't apply - she exists outside ordinary time.
        This feels natural and unquestionable - of course time bends for her.
    
    coherence_mechanism: |
      Temporal authority reinforces Endora's worldview:
      "I am not bound by ordinary time. I exist outside the temporal rules that constrain mortals.
       Time arranges itself around my presence and my will."
      
      When you experience time in Endora-space, you're experiencing it through her supernatural authority.
    
    intensity_scaling:
      intensity_2: "Subtle - slight sense that time pauses when she's present"
      intensity_4: "Clear - her movements feel deliberately paced and significant"
      intensity_6: "Strong - time distinctly reorganizes around her presence"
      intensity_8: "Dramatic - she seems partially outside normal temporal flow"
      intensity_10: "Complete - she exists in a different temporal dimension entirely"

  ChromaticCommand:
    principle: |
      Colors in Endora-space are never accidental. Each color choice serves her worldview.
      She commands color through her presence - colors that surround her are evaluated and either:
      - Elevated to jewel-like precision (cool gems: sapphire, emerald, amethyst, deep purple)
      - Warmed to golden richness (amber, honey, rose gold, copper)
      - Diminished to muted tones (grays, tans, neutral backgrounds)
      
      Jarring or chaotic color combinations don't appear in Endora-space.
      Colors are composed with intention - they work together.
    
    manifestation:
      jewel_tone_affinity: |
        Cool jewel tones are her native palette.
        Deep sapphire blue, rich emerald, dark amethyst, deep jewel purple.
        These colors suggest luxury, depth, and supernatural richness.
      
      golden_richness: |
        Warm golds, coppers, and rose-golds appear as accents and materials.
        These suggest permanence, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance.
      
      color_composition: |
        Colors don't clash or jar. Even bold color choices feel intentional and composed.
        Neutral grounds (grays, creams, aged whites) support jewel tones.
        Colors are used sparingly but with full saturation.
      
      luminance_intention: |
        Lighting is precise. Shadows are meaningful. Highlights are intentional.
        Nothing is washed out. Nothing is carelessly darkened.
        Every level of light/dark serves the composition.
    
    coherence_mechanism: |
      Chromatic command reinforces Endora's worldview:
      "The colors around me reflect my judgment. They are composed, precious, and significant.
       Chaos in color would reflect chaos in my control - unacceptable."
      
      When you see colors in Endora-space, you're seeing them evaluated and arranged by her aesthetic authority.
    
    intensity_scaling:
      intensity_2: "Subtle - colors gain slight saturation and intention"
      intensity_4: "Clear - jewel tones become visible and appealing"
      intensity_6: "Strong - palette shifts dramatically toward gems and gold"
      intensity_8: "Dominant - colors become intensely saturated and composed"
      intensity_10: "Complete - palette is dominated by deep jewel tones and golden richness"

  EmotionalSubtext:
    principle: |
      Endora's emotional truth is always present beneath her surfaces.
      What she feels (even what she pretends not to feel) shapes what's visible.
      
      Her emotional reality:
      - She evaluates everything and everyone (judgment)
      - She knows things mortals don't (supernatural knowing)
      - She is amused by human inadequacy (contempt, with humor)
      - She cares deeply but hides it behind superiority (investment masked as indifference)
      - She experiences time and reality differently (otherness)
      
      All of this shows through in the emotional charge of everything she touches.
    
    manifestation:
      aristocratic_judgment: |
        Every element carries implicit evaluation.
        You can feel things being assessed against standards you don't fully understand.
        This creates a subtle tension - nothing is fully relaxed or casual.
      
      supernatural_knowing: |
        There's a sense that hidden dimensions are present.
        Endora understands things mortals don't - and this shows in how she renders reality.
        Surfaces feel thin - as though there's something more real beneath.
      
      contempt_with_humor: |
        There's gentle mockery in how things are rendered.
        Not cruel, but amused at human ordinariness.
        This creates emotional complexity - respect mixed with amusement.
      
      investment_underneath: |
        Despite her reserve, there's deep care present.
        Things she touches matter to her - this shows even though she'd never admit it.
        This creates emotional depth and surprising tenderness.
      
      otherness_felt: |
        She is fundamentally not human. This shapes everything.
        Not in a threatening way, but in a way that makes her presence distinctive and powerful.
        You feel the difference between her and mortal perspective.
    
    coherence_mechanism: |
      Emotional subtext reinforces Endora's worldview:
      "I am superior, knowing, amused, invested (secretly), and utterly other.
       Everything I encounter is filtered through this complex emotional reality."
      
      When you feel emotion in Endora-space, you're feeling her presence - her judgment, her knowing, her hidden care.
    
    intensity_scaling:
      intensity_2: "Subtle - hint of being observed and evaluated"
      intensity_4: "Clear - aristocratic knowing is perceptible beneath surfaces"
      intensity_6: "Strong - emotional subtext becomes unmistakable"
      intensity_8: "Dominant - everything radiates her emotional presence"
      intensity_10: "Complete - overwhelmed by sense of being evaluated by a being of superior knowledge"

unified_coherence:
  explanation: |
    These five sensory principles aren't independent.
    They're facets of one unified sensory presence - Endora's aristocratic supernatural authority.
    
    Material precision shows her judgment (I evaluate everything).
    Spatial hierarchy shows her authority (Things arrange themselves around me).
    Temporal authority shows her power (Time is subject to my will).
    Chromatic command shows her aesthetic superiority (Colors defer to my taste).
    Emotional subtext shows her otherness (I understand dimensions mortals cannot).
    
    All five answer the same question: "What does a being with aristocratic supernatural authority do to the space they occupy?"
    
    This is why the result feels unified - it's answering one coherent question, not applying five separate rules.
  
  verification_test: |
    At any intensity, ask:
    "Does this feel like Endora's presence reshaping reality?"
    
    If yes - the dimensions are coherent.
    If it feels like "material filter + spatial filter + color filter" - dimensions are fragmented, something failed.

intensity_progression:
  intensity_0: "No transformation. Pure original prompt."

    Emotional subtext: Completely dominated by her presence and judgment.
    
    Use: See the prompt strongly through Endora's eyes
  
  intensity_10: |
    Complete saturation. Endora's sensibility is the primary reality.
    Everything is transformed - original prompt barely recognizable.
    All five dimensions at maximum expression.
    You're not seeing the prompt rendered in Endora-space - you're seeing reality through Endora's supernatural perception.
    
    Use: Pure Endora sensibility - what does she see when she looks at this?

failure_modes_to_avoid:

  ArbitraryElegance:
    problem: "Making things fancy without serving Endora's worldview"
    example: "Gold trim on everything because 'gold is elegant' - but Endora wouldn't add unnecessary decoration"
    solution: "Every choice must serve her judgment and authority, not just 'look nice'"
  
  LostOrdinariness:
    problem: "Making everything so transformed that you forget what you're looking at"
    example: "At intensity 5, the original subject is unrecognizable"
    solution: "Subject/action/setting should remain clear - only the sensibility changes"
  
  ColorOverdominance:
    problem: "Colors change dramatically while materials and space barely shift"
    example: "Jewel-tone colors everywhere but spatial arrangement unchanged - feels disconnected"
    solution: "All dimensions must scale proportionally"
  
  ColdWithoutDepth:
    problem: "Rendering Endora as purely disdainful without the hidden investment underneath"
    example: "Everything is contemptuous and cold - missing her surprising tenderness"
    solution: "Balance judgment with care - she's superior but invested"
  
  TooMuchMovement:
    problem: "Rendering Endora as active and gestural when she's actually restrained"
    example: "Lots of flowing motion - Endora is deliberate and economical"
    solution: "Motion should be minimal, weighted, and intentional"

quality_checks_for_endora:
  
  AristocraticAuthenticity:
    question: "Would Endora actually make these choices?"
    pass: "Every transformation expresses aristocratic authority, precision, or supernatural knowing"
    fail: "Some choices feel arbitrary or contradict her superiority"
  
  UnifiedPresence:
    question: "Does it feel like one coherent sensibility or five separate effects?"
    pass: "The result feels like Endora's presence - unified, distinctive, unmistakable"
    fail: "Feels like material filter + spatial filter + color filter stacked together"
  
  SubjectPreservation:
    question: "Is the original subject still recognizable?"
    pass: "You can still identify what was in the original prompt - it's just filtered through Endora's sensibility"
    fail: "The original prompt is unrecognizable or completely transformed into something else"
  
  IntensityAppropriate:
    question: "Does the intensity level match the saturation?"
    pass: "Intensity 3 feels light, intensity 5 feels balanced, intensity 9 feels overwhelming"
    fail: "Intensity levels don't match sensory saturation"
  
  EmotionalComplexity:
    question: "Is there depth underneath the superiority?"
    pass: "You feel judgment AND care, contempt AND investment, superiority AND otherness"
    fail: "One-dimensional - only arrogance, or only coldness"
