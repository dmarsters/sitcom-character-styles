# Sitcom Character Styles - Layer 1: Categorical Structure
# Framework for modeling character sensory logic as continuous deformation operators
# 
# Core insight: A character's sensory logic is a unified operator that continuously
# deforms visual fields across all dimensions (material, spatial, temporal, chromatic, emotional)
# with a single intensity parameter (0-10).

types:
  VisualField:
    description: "The input domain being transformed - a semantic description of what to render"
    properties:
      base_prompt: "Natural language description of visual content"
      semantic_components:
        - subject: "What/who is being depicted"
        - action: "What's happening"
        - setting: "Where and when"
        - objects: "Things present in the scene"
        - colors: "Color information in the prompt"
        - mood: "Emotional atmosphere"
    comment: "VisualField is the source of the transformation"

  CharacterOperator:
    description: "A unified sensory logic embodied by a character, functioning as a continuous deformation operator"
    subtypes:
      EndoraOperator: "Aristocratic supernatural presence - hierarchical, material, authoritative"
      MorkOperator: "Alien absurdist sincerity - incongruity-based, emotionally direct, permission-granting"
    properties:
      name: "Character name"
      core_sensory_logic: "The unified principle governing all transformations"
      transformation_dimensions:
        - material_presence: "How objects/surfaces are rendered"
        - spatial_hierarchy: "How composition is arranged"
        - temporal_authority: "How time/motion is experienced"
        - chromatic_command: "How colors function"
        - emotional_subtext: "How feeling is conveyed"
    comment: "CharacterOperator is a single unified deformation field, not a collection of discrete choices"

  IntensityParameter:
    description: "Scalar intensity (0-10) that continuously modulates operator strength"
    properties:
      value: "Float from 0 to 10"
      semantics:
        0: "No transformation - original prompt unchanged"
        1-3: "Subtle - character sensory logic barely perceptible"
        4-6: "Moderate - character influence clearly present but not overwhelming"
        7-8: "Strong - character sensory logic dominates but doesn't erase prompt content"
        9-10: "Overwhelming - character sensory logic fully saturates the visual field"
    comment: "Intensity creates a continuous transformation space, not discrete states"

  TransformedVisualField:
    description: "The output domain - the original visual field reshaped by character operator at given intensity"
    properties:
      enhanced_prompt: "Natural language description with character sensory logic applied"
      semantic_components: "Same structure as VisualField but with character-specific modifications"
    comment: "TransformedVisualField is the target of the transformation"

morphisms:
  CharacterDeformation:
    source: VisualField
    target: TransformedVisualField
    functor: "Apply unified character operator to visual field"
    inputs:
      - visual_field: VisualField
      - operator: CharacterOperator
      - intensity: IntensityParameter
    outputs:
      - transformed_field: TransformedVisualField
    properties:
      deterministic: true
      coherence_preserving: true
      comment: "Single morphism: the unified deformation operation. No intermediate selections."
    
  IntensityScaling:
    source: IntensityParameter
    target: "Operator Strength Space"
    description: "Maps intensity value to modulation strength across all transformation dimensions"
    properties:
      continuous: true
      linear_by_default: true
      proportional_scaling: "All dimensions scale proportionally with intensity"
      comment: "All dimensions (material, spatial, temporal, chromatic, emotional) vary together"

commutative_diagrams:
  UnifiedOperatorCoherence:
    description: "Applying character operator at any intensity produces coherent result"
    diagram:
      - step1: "Start with VisualField"
      - step2a: "Apply Endora operator at intensity 5"
      - step2b: "Apply Endora operator at intensity 3, then at intensity 2"
      - convergence: "Results should be materially similar (path independence)"
      - principle: "Endora's sensory logic is unified - different intensities of the same operator cohere"
    
  CompositionWithIntensity:
    description: "Character operator at high intensity doesn't produce incoherent contradictions"
    diagram:
      - constraint1: "Material precision + spatial hierarchy + temporal authority"
      - constraint2: "These four dimensions must reinforce each other, not contradict"
      - constraint3: "At any intensity, the result should feel unified, not fragmented"
      - verification: "Does a high-intensity Endora transformation feel like one sensibility, or four separate ones?"

relationships:
  operator_to_principles:
    description: "Character operator is NOT a sum of independent principles. It is one unified logic with multiple manifestations."
    structure:
      - EndoraOperator: "Single unified 'aristocratic supernatural authority' that manifests as material precision AND spatial hierarchy AND temporal authority AND emotional subtext simultaneously"
      - note: "These are not separate choices. They are aspects of one coherent sensory field."
  
  intensity_to_coherence:
    description: "Higher intensity amplifies the entire operator proportionally"
    constraint: "Intensity cannot change the *kind* of operator - only its *strength*"
    example: "Endora at intensity 2 is not 'different' from Endora at intensity 8. It is the same sensibility, differently saturated."

framework_principles:
  - UnifiedOperator: "Character is ONE sensory logic, not a collection of aesthetic choices"
  - ContinuousDeformation: "Operator is applied with intensity 0-10, not selected from discrete options"
  - CoherenceByDesign: "Categorical structure ensures transformations are internally consistent"
  - DimensionalProportionality: "All transformation dimensions scale together with intensity"
  - IntentionalityPreservation: "The olog exists to make the sensory logic reproducible and defensible"

comparison_to_game_show_aesthetics:
  game_show_pattern: "Discrete selections - choose era, palette, materials, lighting, camera from enumerated options"
  character_pattern: "Continuous deformation - apply character operator with intensity 0-10"
  categorical_difference: "Game show morphisms are selections between finite states. Character morphisms are continuous transformations in a deformation space."
  philosophical_implication: "Characters embody a unified sensory logic, while game show eras are distinct historical moments."
