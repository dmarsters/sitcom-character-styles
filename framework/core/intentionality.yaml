# Sitcom Character Styles - Layer 2: Intentionality Framework
# Explains why and how character sensory logic produces coherent transformations

core_principle:
  statement: "A character's sensory logic is a coherent philosophical worldview expressed through visual choices. When applied to a visual field, it imposes that worldview consistently across all dimensions."
  implication: "Coherence isn't achieved through rules - it emerges from the unified sensibility underlying all choices."

intentionality_structure:
  description: "Each character operator has sensory principles that explain why its transformations cohere"
  components:
    - core_worldview: "The character's underlying philosophy about reality"
    - sensory_principles: "How that worldview manifests across sensory domains"
    - coherence_mechanisms: "Why these principles reinforce rather than contradict each other"
    - intensity_semantics: "How the entire sensibility scales with intensity"

framework_sensory_principles:
  MaterialAuthenticity:
    description: "Materials are chosen for meaning, not accident. They carry history, intention, and significance."
    framework_application: |
      For any character operator:
      - At low intensity: Keep original materials mostly unchanged
      - At moderate intensity: Materials gain subtle intention and significance
      - At high intensity: Every material choice becomes laden with meaning
    coherence_mechanism: "Material precision reinforces the character's overall worldview - if the character values precision, materials become precise; if the character values authenticity, materials become honest"
  
  SpatialIntention:
    description: "Space is never neutral. It's always composed according to values - hierarchy, equality, chaos, precision, etc."
    framework_application: |
      For any character operator:
      - At low intensity: Spatial relationships remain mostly original
      - At moderate intensity: Subtle reorganization begins; some elements gain prominence
      - At high intensity: Complete spatial reorganization according to character's values
    coherence_mechanism: "How space is organized reveals what the character values - centrality reveals authority, dispersal reveals equality, asymmetry reveals dynamic tension"
  
  TemporalAuthenticity:
    description: "Time moves according to the character's relationship to reality. Rushed characters experience compression; patient characters experience expansion."
    framework_application: |
      For any character operator:
      - At low intensity: Temporal flow remains largely normal
      - At moderate intensity: Subtle sense of time reorganizing around character's presence
      - At high intensity: Complete temporal reorientation; time flows by character's rules
    coherence_mechanism: "How time moves expresses the character's power relationship to reality - do they move with time or does time move for them?"
  
  ChromaticAuthenticity:
    description: "Colors aren't decorative - they're expressions of emotional and philosophical truth. Each color has meaning in the character's worldview."
    framework_application: |
      For any character operator:
      - At low intensity: Color palette shifts subtly toward character's emotional truth
      - At moderate intensity: Character's preferred colors become prominent
      - At high intensity: Complete color transformation; palette is dominated by character's chromatic logic
    coherence_mechanism: "Color choices reveal emotional state and philosophical stance - warm colors suggest openness, cool colors suggest reserve; saturation suggests confidence, desaturation suggests doubt"
  
  EmotionalAuthenticity:
    description: "Emotional subtext is always present beneath the surface. What's felt underneath shapes what's visible on top."
    framework_application: |
      For any character operator:
      - At low intensity: Slight hint of character's emotional truth
      - At moderate intensity: Character's emotions clearly present beneath surfaces
      - At high intensity: Emotional subtext becomes primary - visible in every choice
    coherence_mechanism: "Authentic emotion produces authentic visual choices - if something is emotionally true for the character, it shows in material choices, spatial arrangement, timing, color, and expression"

intensity_semantics:
  philosophical_meaning: |
    Intensity doesn't mean "more of the same aesthetic applied randomly."
    It means "this character's sensory logic increasingly dominates the visual field until their worldview is the primary reality."
  
  progression_principle:
    intensity_0_3: |
      Whisper stage: Character's presence is barely perceptible.
      The original prompt remains primary.
      Character sensory logic appears only in subtle choices.
      Use case: "Give me just a hint of this character's influence"
    
    intensity_4_6: |
      Conversation stage: Character's sensory logic and original prompt are in clear dialogue.
      Neither dominates entirely.
      Character's influence is unmistakable but respectful of original content.
      Use case: "Blend character sensory logic with my prompt about 50/50"
    
    intensity_7_8: |
      Dominance stage: Character's sensory logic clearly dominates.
      Original prompt provides subject matter; character provides sensibility.
      Character's worldview shapes nearly every choice.
      Use case: "Make this prompt strongly influenced by character's sensory logic"
    
    intensity_9_10: |
      Saturation stage: Character's sensory logic is the primary reality.
      Original prompt is barely recognizable through character's lens.
      Character's worldview completely remakes what's visible.
      Use case: "I want to see this through the character's eyes completely"

coherence_mechanisms:
  UnifiedWorldview:
    description: "All transformations emerge from one coherent philosophical stance, not five independent rules"
    mechanism: |
      When a character has a unified worldview (e.g., "aristocratic supernatural authority"),
      that worldview naturally generates consistent choices across all dimensions:
      - Material choices that express superiority
      - Spatial arrangements that show hierarchy
      - Temporal presence that shows inevitability
      - Color choices that show luxury and precision
      - Emotional undertones that show knowing and subtle contempt
      
      These aren't separate rules applied independently - they're facets of one unified logic.
    verification: "If the result feels like five independent filters stacked on top of each other, the implementation has failed. If it feels like one unified sensibility applied with varying saturation, it succeeded."
  
  ProportionalScaling:
    description: "All dimensions intensify together, maintaining their proportional relationships"
    mechanism: |
      At intensity 3: All dimensions are at 3/10 of their maximum effect
      At intensity 5: All dimensions are at 5/10 of their maximum effect
      At intensity 10: All dimensions are at 10/10 of their maximum effect
      
      This ensures coherence - no dimension becomes over-represented or under-represented relative to others.
    constraint: "If one dimension intensifies faster than others, coherence breaks - the result feels unbalanced or contradictory"
  
  IntentionalityPreservation:
    description: "Every transformation choice serves the character's underlying intention, not arbitrary aesthetic rules"
    mechanism: |
      Before applying a transformation:
      Ask: "Would this character make this choice? Does it express their worldview?"
      
      If yes → transformation serves intentionality, coherence is preserved
      If no → transformation is arbitrary, coherence fails
      
      Example: Endora would make a coffee cup material more precious (yes - shows superiority)
               but wouldn't make it psychedelic or chaotic (no - contradicts her control)
    verification: "Can you explain each transformation choice in terms of character's worldview?"

dimensional_coherence:
  principle: "The five dimensions reinforce each other rather than contradict"
  examples:
    aristocratic_character: |
      If a character values aristocratic superiority:
      - Materials become precious (material dimension)
      - Space hierarchizes (spatial dimension)
      - Time becomes authoritative (temporal dimension)
      - Colors become jewel-toned (chromatic dimension)
      - Emotional subtext becomes knowing (emotional dimension)
      
      All five support the same worldview - aristocratic authority.
    
    chaotic_character: |
      If a character embraces productive chaos:
      - Materials clash and combine unexpectedly (material dimension)
      - Space becomes asymmetrical and surprising (spatial dimension)
      - Time becomes unpredictable (temporal dimension)
      - Colors become surprising adjacencies (chromatic dimension)
      - Emotional subtext becomes permissive (emotional dimension)
      
      All five support the same worldview - embracing incongruity.

quality_checks:
  UnifiedSensibility:
    question: "Does the result feel like one character's sensory logic, or like five separate filters?"
    pass: "The result feels unified - recognizably the character's presence reshaping everything"
    fail: "The result feels like multiple effects stacked - material changes don't match spatial changes, colors don't match mood"
  
  IntentionalityFidelity:
    question: "Could the character authentically make these choices?"
    pass: "Every visible choice expresses something true to the character's worldview"
    fail: "Some choices contradict character's core values or feel arbitrary"
  
  ProportionalCoherence:
    question: "Do all dimensions scale together, or does one dominate?"
    pass: "At any intensity, all dimensions are equally present and equally intensified"
    fail: "Some dimensions are over-represented (colors change dramatically while materials barely change)"
  
  PromptRespect:
    question: "Does the transformation preserve what was in the original prompt?"
    pass: "The subject, action, and basic structure remain recognizable, but filtered through character sensory logic"
    fail: "The original prompt is unrecognizable or completely contradicted"

failure_modes_to_avoid:
  ArbitraryAesthetics:
    problem: "Applying aesthetic rules that don't express the character's worldview"
    example: "Making Endora's transformation chaotic because 'chaos looks interesting' (contradicts her precision)"
    prevention: "Every choice must be justifiable through character's worldview"
  
  DimensionalImbalance:
    problem: "One dimension intensifying while others remain weak"
    example: "Strong color shift but spatial arrangement unchanged (feels disconnected)"
    prevention: "All dimensions must scale proportionally with intensity"
  
  PromptObliteration:
    problem: "Applying character so strongly that original prompt disappears"
    example: "At intensity 5, original prompt is unrecognizable (should require intensity 9-10)"
    prevention: "Respect the prompt throughout intensity scale; only at 9-10 should character completely dominate"
  
  FilterStacking:
    problem: "Treating dimensions as independent effects to layer on top of each other"
    example: "Color filter + spatial filter + material filter = disconnected effects instead of unified sensibility"
    prevention: "Think of dimensions as manifestations of one unified logic, not separate operations"

application_guidelines:
  ForImplementers: |
    When building the execution layer:
    1. Start with the character's core worldview (what do they believe about reality?)
    2. For each transformation dimension, ask: "How would this worldview express itself?"
    3. Build transformations that answer those questions
    4. Test coherence: Do all dimensions reinforce each other?
    5. Test intentionality: Does each choice serve the character's purpose?
    6. Test scaling: Do all dimensions intensify together?
  
  ForUsers: |
    When applying the operator:
    1. At intensity 1-3: Character barely whispers - use to add subtle character flavor
    2. At intensity 4-6: Character and prompt dialogue - blend two sensibilities
    3. At intensity 7-8: Character dominates - use when you want strong character influence
    4. At intensity 9-10: Character is primary reality - use to see through character's eyes
